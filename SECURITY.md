## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.
Please do a pull request. the open source coding will help the development of it, also don't try anything funny, the code knows who made it :P
Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
